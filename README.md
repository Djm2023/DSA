<h1> 🚀 LEARN ABOUT BASICS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 🚀 </h1>

👉<b> What is the objective of Object oriented programming in C++</b> ?

💥 The main objective of Object oriented programming is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

<hr/>

✍ The building blocks for Object oriented programming are :-

✨ <b>class</b></br>
✨ <b>Object</b></br>
✨ <b>Encapsulation</b></br>
✨ <b>Abstraction</b></br>
✨ <b>Polymorphism</b></br>
✨ <b>Inheritance</b></br>
✨ <b>Dynamic Binding</b></br>
✨ <b>Message Passing</b></br>

👉<b> What is the class in Object oriented programming? </b> ?

💥 It is the user-defined data type which holds its own data members and member functions which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.



<hr/>

👉<b> What is the data members and member functions? </b> ?

💥 DATA MEMBERS :- Data members are the data variables used in the class.
<br/>
💥 MEMBER FUNCTION :-Member function are the functions used in the class to modify data variables.
